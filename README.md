## ![WIP](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=status&message=WIP&color=yellow&style=for-the-badge)

This is a hobby project that is still a work in progress. It's something I hope to come back to every now and then to introduce new features etc.

It's likely that there will be long periods of time where nothing changes, and equally likely that it will be completely re-written over a short space of time.
